                <br>
                <p>
                    Simulation is favored by roboticists to evaluate controller design and software. Often, state machines are
                    drawn to convey overall ideas and used as a basis to program tool-specific simulations. The simulation code,
                    written in general or proprietary programming languages, is, however, the only full account of the robotic system.
                    In this course, we present the RoboStar technology, a modern approach to design that supports automatic
                    generation of simulation code guaranteed to be correct with respect to a design model, and complements simulation
                    with model checking, theorem proving, and automatic test generation for simulation. Diagrammatic domain-specific,
                    but tool-independent, notations for design and simulation use state machines, differential equations, and
                    controlled English to specify behavior.
                    This course will be co-lectured by Gustavo Carvalho, Matt Windsor, Alvaro Miyazawa and James Baxter from University of York.

                    Jim Woodcock FREng is the Professor of Software Engineering at the University of York. He holds two additional
                    posts: he is a Professor of Digital Twins at Aarhus University in Denmark and a 1,000-talents Professor of
                    Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) at Southwest University in Chongqing. He is an award-winning researcher with
                    40 years' experience in formal methods for software engineering. He has widely cited theoretical work in
                    efficient verification algorithms for security and in more general software and hardware semantics. His work
                    has been widely used in practice. He is a long-term consultant to the UK government on system security
                    verification, including co-authoring a secure office automation system for the UK government. He created
                    the theory and practical verification for NatWest Bank's Mondex smart-card system, the first commercial
                    product to achieve ITSEC Level E6 (Common Criteria EAL 7). He has made significant contributions to the
                    Verified Software Initiative. He was a principal investigator in the EU FP7 COMPASS project on model-based
                    systems of systems and in the EU H2020 INTO-CPS project on integrated toolchains for CPS. He currently leads
                    the research team in York for the Verifiability Research Node in the EPSRC Trusted Autonomous Systems
                    Programme. For the last decade, he has researched the theory and practice of CPS and, more recently,
                    verified robotics and digital twins. He leads the research team that is developing theories for modelling
                    and verifying CPS and robotics using the Isabelle/UTP theorem prover. Jim is a fellow of the UK Royal
                    Academy of Engineering and a Chartered Engineer. He has served as head of the Department of Computer
                    Science in York.

<!--                    Critical flaws continue to exist at the level of domain, requirement, and/or design specification, and specification verification,-->
<!--                    i.e., to prove a specification has desirable properties, is still one of the most important challenges in software engineering.-->
<!--                    CafeOBJ is an executable algebraic specification language system that can be used for specification verification by writing proof-->
<!--                    scores. Domain/requirement/design engineers using CafeOBJ are expected to construct proof scores for getting reliable specifications-->
<!--                    . CafeOBJ is a sister language of OBJ and proof scores have been brought up by the OBJ/CafeOBJ community.-->
<!--                    Specification verification is theorem proving where the specification is a set of axioms and the desirable properties are theorems.-->
<!--                    Fully automatic theorem proving often fails to convey an understanding of proof, and one should seek to make optimal use of the respective abilities of humans and computers, so that computers do the tedious formal calculations, and humans do the high level planning. Proof scores intend to meet these goals by hiding the detailed calculations done by machines while revealing the proof plan created by humans.-->
